# Game_of_life

This is a simple python implementation of the Game of life designed by John Horton Conway using the Pygame library.

Teh source code contains an initial configuration (which can be changed by the user) and also allows for the user to make changes in real time to affect how the "game" develops.

To execute it, simply navigate to the directory where the source code is, type `python GameOfLife.py` and hit Enter. You will be prompted with a grid containing some white squares (the initial configuration), where you can add new "cells" by left clicking on the squares of the grid. You can also (when there are static "cells") delete them by right clicking them.
